# XenBot

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

General Purpose Chatbot that assists the elderly, people in-need, marginalized groups. It aims at being the best company for people who suffer from loneliness and societal neglect.

## Background

XenBot aims at being an assistant by :
* Engaging in interactive conversations in real-time.
* Provide advice, plans, best decision to make
* etc.


## How is it used?

XenBot is general-purpose, and anyone can use it anywhere and anytime. However, its main concern is to help people who face difficulties in societies, this includes groups who face constant societal judgement, rejection or neglect.


## Data sources and AI methods

Since it's general purpose, the dataset will have to be quite large, while also keeping track of data acquired in rel-time. It would use learning agents, as well as use probabilistic representation, planning, natural language processing, as well as computer vision.

## Challenges

Some challenges would come in the form of the datasets trained on, a large one would require expensive computations. XenBot doesn't focus on solving problems related to STEM fields.

## What next?

I'm hoping that XenBot becomes a sentient bot, capable of expressing emotions, has a sense of identity, and so on. I strongly believe that could be achieved.
