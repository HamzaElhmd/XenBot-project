# XenBot

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

XenBot aims at supporting people in need of a support system.

## Background

General Purpose Chatbot that assists the elderly, people in-need, marginalized groups. It aims at bringing the best company for people who suffer from loneliness and neglect from society.

## How is it used?

XenBot is general-purpose, and anyone can use it anywhere and anytime. However, its main concern is to help people who face difficulties in societies, and be their support system.

## Data sources and AI methods

Since it's general purpose, the dataset will have to be quite large, while also keeping track of data acquired in rel-time. It would use learning agents, as well as use probabilistic representation, planning, natural language processing, as well as computer vision.

## Challenges

Some challenges would come in the form of the datasets trained on, a large one would require expensive computations. XenBot doesn't focus on solving problems related to STEM fields.

## What next?

I'm aiming at XenBot to become a sentient bot, capable of expressing emotions, has a sense of identity, and so on. I strongly believe that could be achieved.
